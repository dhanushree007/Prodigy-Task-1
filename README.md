# Prodigy-Task-1
## Overview

This project is aimed at performing data analysis and visualization on a dataset named `task.csv`. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and visualize key insights to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis focuses on handling missing data, performing basic aggregations, and visualizing the results for the top 5 countries by average count of relevant data points.

## Requirements

To successfully run the notebook, you will need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: For label encoding and preprocessing

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

**pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
**

## Data Preparation

The dataset `task.csv` is loaded using `pandas`. After loading, the script checks for missing values and handles them by removing any rows containing `NaN` values.

- **Missing Values**: Missing values are handled by dropping rows with `NaN` using `df.dropna(inplace=True)`. 
- **Data Aggregation**: We compute the average of the numeric columns from the 5th column onward and store the result in a new column named `Average`.

## Key Analysis

### 1. **Top 5 Countries by Average Count**:
   After calculating the `Average` for each country, the dataset is sorted in descending order to extract the top 5 countries. This serves as a way to highlight countries with the highest averages based on the data in the provided columns.

### 2. **Visualization**:
   A bar chart is created to display the top 5 countries along with their respective average values. The chart is well-labeled with rotated x-axis labels to ensure readability.

## How to Run the Script

1. Load the data by downloading the `task.csv` file into your working directory.
2. Execute the code in any Python IDE, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.
3. The script will clean the data, calculate the averages, and display a bar chart of the top 5 countries by their average.

## Output

The script outputs:
1. A cleaned dataset with missing values handled.
2. A new column `Average` showing the mean value for relevant columns.
3. A bar chart showing the top 5 countries by their average values.


## Notes

- Make sure that the dataset (`task.csv`) is correctly formatted with relevant numeric data starting from the 5th column onwards for proper aggregation.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and that the dataset is available in the correct path.
  

## Future Improvements

- Handle missing data with advanced techniques (e.g., imputation) instead of simply dropping rows.
- Explore additional visualizations to derive more insights.
- Incorporate more sophisticated analysis using machine learning techniques if needed.
